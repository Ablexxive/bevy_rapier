# Changelog

## 0.5.0
### Changed
- We now use the latest version of Bevy: 0.3.0

### Added
- Rigid-bodies, colliders, and joints, will automatically removed from the Rapier
  sets when their corresponding Bevy components are removed.

## 0.4.0
This release update the plugin to the latest version of Rapier, which itself
includes lots of new features. Refer to the Rapier changelogs for details.

### Added
- A `InteractionPairFilters` resource where you can your own filters for contact pair
and proximity pair filtering. Before considering the use of a custom filter, consider
using collision groups instead (as it is faster, but less versatile).

### Changed
- The stepping system now applies interpolation between two physics state at render time.
  Refer to [that issue](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier/pull/19) and the following
